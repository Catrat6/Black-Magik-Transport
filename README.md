## Mock NEMT Company

This is a landing page that I am building as a mock NEMT compnay for a training project I have to do at my work.

This part is not required, we are given our own server and have to go through the process the customer would when getting set up with our SaaS.

I just wanted to do this on my own as a little extra to really get in the mindset, plus its been a long time since I have built a custom page from scratch so I am having fun with it.

- Basic landing page 
- JavaScript Navbar smoothes out the experience
- Easy to book a ride through iframe
- Responsive and smooth on desktop and mobile (or at least what me and my browser tools could test.)

All in all pretty slick for something probably no one ever is going to appreciate haha.
